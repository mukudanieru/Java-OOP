# **_Java OOP Projects/Laboratories (FOR UNI)_**

#### Description:

Welcome to my OOP Projects/Lab repository. This repository contains a collection of Java projects and laboratory assignments related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) completed during my university studies.

## **_Project Description_**

**University Laboratories:**

### **`Laboratory #1 - PERIMETER AND AREA CALCULATOR`**

**Description:**

This introductory laboratory focuses on fundamental Java concepts, with an emphasis on methods. The project involves creating a Perimeter and Area Calculator, where users can input the dimensions of various shapes, and the program calculates and displays both the perimeter and area. This exercise serves as a foundation for understanding Java methods and their role in organizing code.

### **`Laboratory #2 - Personal info, base of triangle calculator, and sum of all input numbers`**

**Description:**

In this comprehensive laboratory, we explore the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project is a versatile three-in-one program that encompasses various functionalities. Initially, users can input personal information, showcasing fundamental data handling concepts. Subsequently, users have the option to choose between a calculator for the base of a triangle or a program that calculates a series of inputted numbers. Finally, users will view both their personal information and the output of their selected program. This lab serves as an introductory exploration of OOP principles and highlights the benefits of modular code organization.

### **`Laboratory #3 - SIMPLE PAYROLL SIMULATOR`**

**Description:**

Building on the foundation of OOP introduced in the previous lab, Laboratory #3 focuses on the concept of inheritance. The project involves creating a Simple Payroll Simulator, where different types of employees inherit common attributes and behaviors. This lab reinforces the concept of code reusability through inheritance and sets the stage for more complex OOP applications.

### **`Laboratory #4 - INSURANCE SIMULATOR`**

**Description:**

Continuing the exploration of OOP, Laboratory #4 delves into the concept of encapsulation. The project involves building an Insurance Simulator, where the intricacies of insurance policies are encapsulated within classes. This lab emphasizes the importance of data hiding and encapsulation in creating robust and secure software systems.

### **`Laboratory #5 - DIFFERENT PAYMODE SIMULATOR`**

**Description:**

Laboratory #5 introduces the concept of polymorphism through the creation of a Different Paymode Simulator. In this project, users can simulate payments using cash, eWallet, or card, showcasing the flexibility and extensibility of polymorphic behavior. This lab underscores the power of polymorphism in simplifying code and accommodating diverse payment methods within a unified structure.

### **`MIDTERMS Laboratory - SPECIALIZED MIDTERMS Laboratory: ATM SIMULATOR`**

**Description:**

For the midterms exam, we simulated ATM Simulator that combines and reinforces the principles we learned from the previous labs. This comprehensive project involves creating an ATM simulation system, incorporating elements of methods, OOP concepts (inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism), and user interaction. The ATM Simulator serves as a practical application of Java OOP principles, providing a holistic understanding of object-oriented design and programming.

**PROJECT CODING projects:**

### **`Cartesian Simulator`**

**Description:**

In the Cartesian Project, the primary focus is on geometric representation within a Cartesian coordinate system. The project revolves around a Main class that interacts with a Point class. The Point class encapsulates the essential attributes and behaviors of a point in a Cartesian plane, allowing for efficient and modular handling of geometric data. This project serves as an exploration of object-oriented principles in the context of Cartesian coordinates and reinforces the concepts of class structure and encapsulation.

### **`Inventory Manager Lab`**

**Description:**

The Inventory Manager Lab involves the development of an Inventory Manager system. This project is designed to showcase principles of object-oriented programming and effective data management. The lab includes the creation of classes and methods to handle inventory-related operations, emphasizing encapsulation and modular code organization. The Inventory Manager Lab provides practical experience in implementing OOP concepts for efficient and maintainable inventory management systems.

### **`Simple Poll Simulator`**

**Description:**

The Simple Poll Simulator project introduces a simulation of a basic polling system. With a user-friendly interface, participants can engage in polls and surveys, providing their responses to various questions. The project emphasizes the principles of user interaction, data storage, and result analysis. Through the implementation of classes and methods, this simulator serves as an accessible introduction to object-oriented programming concepts, including user input handling and result aggregation.

### **`Task Manager Lab`**

**Description:**

The Task Manager Lab involves the creation of a robust Task Manager system. This project focuses on applying object-oriented programming principles to efficiently manage and organize tasks. Classes and methods are employed to represent tasks, and the system allows for the addition, removal, and tracking of tasks. The lab emphasizes the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a hands-on experience in designing and implementing a task management application using Java OOP.

### **`Expressions Lab`**

**Description:**

The Expressions lab! This project explores the concept of abstract classes in Java, focusing on the representation of mathematical expressions. The central abstract class, Expressions, serves as the foundation for various expression types, including variable expressions, constant expressions, addition expressions, multiplication expressions, and negated expressions.
